          <p><span itemprop="name">Judge Anne Lazarus</span> is standing for retention this year. She has been honored to serve the citizens of Pennsylvania over the last 10 years as a <span itemprop="jobTitle">Superior Court judge</span>. While her main office is in Philadelphia, she has sat in Harrisburg, Pittsburgh,
            and several other counties over the last 10 years. <span itemprop="affiliation">The Pennsylvania Superior Court</span> is the busiest intermediate appellate court in the country. For many cases, the Superior Court is the final say, since the Supreme Court is not obligated to
            review most cases that are filed.</p>

          <p>Judge Lazarus never forgets that the cases that she reviews are of the utmost importance to the litigants who appear before her; she always remembers that the citizens of Pennsylvania voted for her and they are to whom she is accountable.</p>

          <p>With over 28 years of experience as a trial and appellate judge, Judge Lazarus has seen Pennsylvanians during some of the most difficult times of their lives and understands how an effective and efficient judicial
            system can make a difference for so many.</p>

          <p>She has dedicated her career to upholding the highest standards for our courts as Chair of the Judicial Conduct Board and as Chair of the ad hoc committee that rewrote the Canons of Judicial Conduct. </p>

          <p>In addition to her work on the bench, Judge Lazarus has been honored for her work to encourage pro bono representation to ensure that everyone has equal access to our judicial system. She knows the importance of giving back, which is why she
            teaches high school and law school classes, mentors young lawyers, and gives her free time to community service. </p>
